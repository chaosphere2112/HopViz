# HopViz

Simple visualization for looking at what hops get used together by homebrewers

Provides a (crummy) UI wrapped around a D3 visualization of hop pairings by homebrewers. The data is gathered from ~4000 recipes off of HomeBrewTalk.com.

Click on a hop to see what other hops are used with it; the closer the circles are to the center circle, the more frequently they are paired.

You can toggle on/off various styles if you're only interested in those ones by clicking on the associated checkbox on the left side.
